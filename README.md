## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 📌 **Option 1: How to Contribute to the Edu-Rent Project**
#### This guide outlines the step-by-step process for contributing code to the project. We use a "Fork and Pull Request" model to maintain code quality and a clean history.

### Branch Naming Pattern
#### To keep our work organized, please follow this pattern for all new branches:
#### type/short-description
 - type: Describes the kind of change you are making.
 - feat: For a new feature (e.g., feat/student-profile-page).
 - fix: For a bug fix (e.g., fix/login-password-mismatch).
 - docs: For changes to documentation (e.g., docs/update-readme).
 - style: For code style changes that don't affect logic (e.g., style/reformat-css-files).
 - refactor: For code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (e.g., refactor/simplify-view-logic).
 - short-description: A few words separated by hyphens that summarize the change.

----

## Part 1: One-Time Setup
#### You only need to do this once at the beginning.

#### Step 1: Fork the Repository
 - First, you need to create your own personal copy of the main project repository on GitHub.
 - Navigate to the main repository URL: https://github.com/theo2815/CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT
 - In the top-right corner of the page, click the Fork button.
 - This will create a new repository under your own GitHub account
   (https://github.com/your-username/CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT). This is your personal fork.

----
### Step 2: Clone Your Fork to Your Computer
#### Now, download the code from your personal fork to your local machine.
1. On your fork's GitHub page, click the green < > Code button.
2. Copy the HTTPS URL provided.
3. Open your terminal or Git Bash and run the following command, replacing the URL with the one you just copied:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT.git
```
4. Navigate into the newly created project folder:
```bash
cd CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT
```
----

### Step 3: Configure Remotes
#### You need to tell your local repository about the original "upstream" project so you can keep your fork updated with the team's latest changes.
1. Your fork is already configured as the origin remote. You can verify this by running git remote -v.
2. Now, add the original project repository as a new remote called upstream
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/theo2815/CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT.git
```
3. Verify that you now have two remotes (origin and upstream) by runnin
```bash
git remote -v
```
----

## Part 2: The Development Workflow
#### Follow these steps every time you want to start a new feature or bug fix.

### Step 1: Sync Your Fork
#### Before you start writing any new code, you must update your fork with the latest changes from the main project.
1. Make sure you are on your local main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
2. "Pull" the latest changes from the original (upstream) project into your local main branch:
```bash
git pull upstream main
```
3. Push these updates to your personal fork on GitHub (origin) to keep it in sync:
```bash
git push origin main
```
----

### Step 2: Create a New Branch
#### Never work directly on the main branch. Always create a new, descriptive branch for your task.
1. Create and switch to your new branch, following the naming pattern:
```bash
# Example for a new feature:
git checkout -b feat/add-shopping-cart
```
----

### Step 3: Write Your Code
#### This is where you do your work: add features, fix bugs, and make any other changes.

----

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes
#### Save your work to the branch's history.
1. Stage all your changed files:
```bash
git add .
```
2. Commit the changes with a clear, descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Feat: Add shopping cart functionality to browse all product"
```
----

### Step 5: Push Your Branch to Your Fork
#### Upload your new branch and its commits to your personal fork on GitHub.
```bash
git push -u origin feat/add-shopping-cart
```
----

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)
#### The final step is to propose your changes to the main project.
1. Go to your fork's page on GitHub (https://github.com/your-username/CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT).
2. GitHub will automatically detect your newly pushed branch and show a green button that says "Compare & pull request." Click it.
3. Give your pull request a clear title and a brief description of the changes you made.
4. Click the "Create pull request" button.
##### Your work is now submitted for review! The project lead can now review your code, suggest changes, and merge it into the main project.

----

### 📌 **Option 2: Just Using the Project (Direct Clone)**

If you just want to use the application:

```bash
# Clone the repository directly
git clone https://github.com/theo2815/CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd CSIT321-G4-EDU-RENT
```

-----

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
You will run two terminals: one for the backend and one for the frontend.

### ✅ 1. Run the Backend (Spring Boot)
```bash
    cd edurentbackend
```
```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
```
Backend runs at: http://localhost:8080

### ✅ 2. Run the Frontend (React)
```bash
    cd edurentfrontend
```
```bash
    npm install
```
If vulnerabilities appear, you may ignore them during development.


Start the frontend:
```bash
    npm run dev
```
Frontend runs at: http://localhost:5173

-----

## 🧪 Usage Guide
1. Open your browser  
2. Visit http://localhost:5173/login 
3. Register or log in  
4. Browse, add, rent, sell, or buy items
