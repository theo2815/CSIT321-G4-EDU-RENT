/* 
   Since the original SVG path stroke is white and the filling seems to be transparent/white based on the shared snippet,
   we might need to ensure it's visible against the page background.
   The original CSS says `stroke: white`.
   If the user's background is white, this won't be visible.
   However, looking at the provided HTML, there is no specific background color set on the container.
   The SVG acts as the box.
   Wait, the path "M 0 16 V 56 ... " draws the box AND the checkmark?
   Let's assume the stroke needs to be a visible color if the background is light.
   The `ManageListingsPage.jsx` background is `bg-light` (likely white or off-white).
   So `stroke: white` might be invisible.
   I will change the default stroke to a dark color or usage of a variable, 
   but adhering to the "wow" factor, maybe the primary accent color.
   
   However, typically these "Uiverse" checkboxes are self-contained. 
   Let's check the path data visualization mentally:
   It draws a box (0 16 ... to 64 ...) and then seemingly the checkmark.
   
   If I look at the CSS:
   .path { stroke: white; ... }
   
   If this is placed on a white background, it will be invisible.
   I will change it to `var(--text-color)` or `#333` or `black` for safety, 
   or maybe allow it to be passed in. 
   
   Actually, looking at the design usually implies a filled box or outlined box.
   The path seems to trace the OUTLINE of the box and then transforms/animates.
   
   Let's try checking `ManageListingsPage.css` again for background.
   It has `--bg-light` and `--bg-color`.
   
   I will use `black` or a standard color variable for now, 
   or `currentColor` if I want to control it from parents.
   Let's use `black` (or a dark grey) as a safe default for visibility on light mode, 
   and maybe invert for dark mode if needed.
   Better yet, use `var(--text-color, #000)`.
